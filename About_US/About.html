          THE GENESIS OF THE YMCA MOVEMENT
        </h3>
        <p class="Content">
          The YMCA Movement originally began in post-Industrial England of 19th century in London in the drapery
          establishment of M/s Hitchcock and Rodgers in which a young apprentice of 21, George Williams, took initiative in organizing Bible classes in his bedroom in the nature of a mutual edification society which brought
          in a cohesive group of twelve of his co-workers in the establishment from nearly as many denominations of the Christian church to form the very first Young Men’s Christian Association on June 6, 1844 on 72,
          St. Paul’s Churchyard (destroyed during aerial bombings in World War II though, a memorial plaque still remains today at the site where the original building stood). The first World Conference of the YMCAs took place in Paris
          in August 1855 which enacted the foundational principles of the Movement, the Paris Basis. The historic statement defined the basis for membership.

        <p class="Content">
          The march of time saw the World YMCA Movement providing a more contemporary interpretation to the Paris Basis in the Kampala Principles of 1973 and in the Asian
           context this was further redefined contextually as the Manila Declaration of 1977. In 1998, at the XIVth World Council of YMCAs in Frechen, Germany,
           the World YMCA Movement enunciated the “Challenge 21” statement of affirmation. The YMCA movement is the oldest largest lay, Christian, ecumenical, membership
            movement in the world spread across 12000 local associations in 125 countries with 45 million members.

          THE ORIGINS OF THE YMCA MOVEMENT IN INDIA
        </h3>
        <p class="Content">
          The YMCA tradition is not new to India. Way back in 1857 synchronous with the First War of India’s independence, the very first YMCA in Asia took roots in the-then Calcutta, the second Capital of the British Empire. In 2007 the Indian YMCA movement
          joined the YMCA Calcutta in celebrating the 150 years of the YMCA in India. The National Council of YMCAs of India was formed on Madras on February 21, 1891
           through the initiative of David McConaughy, who also became the first National Secretary of what then was called the Indian National Council of YMCAs,
           the forerunner of the National Council of YMCAs of India. The national headquarters shifted to 5, Russell Street in May, 1902 and in 1964, it finally shifted
           to the old one-storey Massey Hall where it was located till 1975 with the very last relocation thereafter till date in the three-storeyed Bharat Yuvak Bhavan on Jai Singh Road,
          New Delhi-110001 in 2002.

          YMCA CALCUTTA AND THE EARLY BEGINNINGS
        </h3>
        <p class="Content">
          The YMCA in India took roots in what is now Kolkata, way back in 1857, though a beginning was made in August 1854. On February 27, 1857,
          the Calcutta Christian Juvenile Society of 1822 formed by John Lawsan, a Baptist Missionary associated with William Carey, changed its name to
          Calcutta Calcutta YMCA . This was the beginning of the very first YMCA in Asia to be followed by the one in Colombo, Trivandrum, Bombay, Madras and several
          others. By the 1880s there were several YMCA's in South India. In 1890, David McConaughy, a young American from the International Committee of the American
           YMCAs arrived in Madras and founded the very first YMCA there. He was later instrumental in forming the Indian National Council of YMCAs, the forerunner of
           the National Council of YMCAs of India, after a conference in 1891. The National Council of YMCAs of India is the apex body of the Indian YMCAs entrusted
            with guiding and overseeing in general the activities of its affiliated associations and providing a direction to the Indian YMCA Movement as a whole.
