				The YMCA Movement originally began in post-Industrial England of 19th century in London in the drapery establishment of M/s
				Hitchcock and Rodgers in which a young apprentice of 21, George Williams, took the initiative in organizing Bible classes in his bedroom in
				the nature of a mutual edification of the society which brought in a cohesive group of 12 of his co-workers from equal number of denominations of the
				christian church to form the Young Menâ€™s Christian Association on June 6, 1844. The National Council of YMCAs of India was formed in Madras on February 21,
				1891 through the initiative of David McConaughy. The headquarters shifted to Calcutta in May, 1902. In 1964 it shifted to New Delhi, its present location.

				The sprawling campus of the National YMCA in upmarket Jai Singh Road now boasts a Hostel, inaugurated on August 30, 2014, which can accommodate 50 persons
				in 25 well-appointed Double-Rooms with all modern amenities at affordable rates though, principally for its YMCA clientele from across India and abroad.
				The Hostel has spacious rooms with shower attached and is well complemented with a multi-cuisine restaurant overlooking the foyer besides car-parking space for its clientele.
				The proximity of the Hostel to the shopping hub of Connaught Place and other places of attraction makes it the obvious choice of the discerning traveler, especially the budget-conscious. A Conference Hall is soon to open in the premises and would be yet another value addition to the facilities provided.
